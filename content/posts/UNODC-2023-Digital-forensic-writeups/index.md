## Dream Big (10 pts)

How much higher is Pac Man than the street?
answer : **6.8**

this was painful question i had no idea how to get but on next week i got hint that i should look on altitude , so that comes in mind that i should check pictures altitude, but how? here what i i did with try and error

**walkthough**
first : i checked a pacman picture altitude

![img](img/q21.png)

using exiftool

```
â”Œâ”€â”€(malwarepeterã‰¿spaceX)-[/mnt/d/AfricaDFIRCTF23WK1/android_13_data/data/media/0/DCIM/Camera]
â””â”€$ exiftool PXL_20220816_221104661.jpg | grep "GPS Altitude"
GPS Altitude Ref                : Above Sea Level
GPS Altitude                    : 128.1 m Above Sea Level
```

enter 128.1 as answer : **i got incorrect**

step 2 : from question "How much higher is Pac Man than the street?" well that means its their different from pacman to street but how? substitute a altitude ?

so i assumed the street is from this pic since it show outside

![img](img/q22.png)

check its altitude

```
â”Œâ”€â”€(malwarepeterã‰¿spaceX)-[/mnt/d/AfricaDFIRCTF23WK1/android_13_data/data/media/0/DCIM/Camera]
â””â”€$ exiftool PXL_20220817_001701864.jpg | grep "GPS Altitude"
GPS Altitude Ref                : Above Sea Level
GPS Altitude                    : 121.2 m Above Sea Level
```

substitute

128.1  - 121.2 = 6.9

enter 6.9 as answer : **got incorrect again**

what now bruteforce? no way

step 3 : back to question again , now there other pics look like conference room maybe i should check them from there to the street, which is below

![img](img/q23.png)

using exiftool

```
â”Œâ”€â”€(malwarepeterã‰¿spaceX)-[/mnt/d/AfricaDFIRCTF23WK1/android_13_data/data/media/0/DCIM/Camera]
â””â”€$ exiftool PXL_20220816_215313565.MP.jpg | grep "GPS Altitude"
GPS Altitude Ref                : Above Sea Level
GPS Altitude                    : 128 m Above Sea Level
```

well, looks like same floor on pacman picture
now 128 - 121.2 = 6.8

enter the answer : **CORRECT**

that was real DREAM BIG as its name say
