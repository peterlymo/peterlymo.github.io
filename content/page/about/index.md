Hi, my name is Peter Lymo (malwarepeter) and I am currently a software engineering student at the University of Dodoma. In addition to my studies, I am also a cyber security enthusiast and bug bounty hunter.

I have always had a strong interest in technology and how it can be used to improve people's lives. As a software engineering student, I am learning the skills and knowledge needed to design, develop, and maintain complex software systems.

In my spare time, I like to stay up-to-date on the latest cyber security trends and techniques. I have participated in several bug bounty programs, where I have helped companies identify and fix vulnerabilities in their systems.

I am passionate about using my skills and expertise to make a positive impact on the world, and I am always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow as a professional.

Thank you for reading my "About Me" article. If you have any questions or would like to connect, feel free to reach out to me via my social media profiles or email.
